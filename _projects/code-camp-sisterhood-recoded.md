### Overview

From 2017–2018, I founded and led community-based coding camps in partnership with Muskingum University and Newark City Schools, including *Sisterhood Recoded* and *Girls Coding for a Cause*.

The programs were designed to introduce foundational computing concepts through structured, hands-on activities, with an emphasis on logical thinking, problem decomposition, and confidence-building.

### Focus

- Designing curriculum that scales in complexity without overwhelming learners  
- Teaching problem-solving through clear sequencing and feedback  
- Adapting instruction based on real-time learner understanding  

### Why this matters

This experience reinforced the importance of clarity, structure, and user-centered thinking—principles that directly inform how I design software systems, documentation, and tests in professional engineering work.

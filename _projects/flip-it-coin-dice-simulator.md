title: "Flip It!! — Simulation Tool (Coin & Dice)"
one_liner: "OOP + state-machine workflow with validation-first input handling and PyTest coverage."
order: 2

### Problem
Interactive tools often become fragile when input paths multiply—making behavior harder to test and extend.

### Solution
Built a Python simulation app for coin flips and dice rolls using:
- **Object-oriented abstraction** (base class + extensible “rollable” objects)
- **State-machine driven control flow** for predictable user interaction
- **Centralized input validation** and exit/restart handling
- **PyTest unit tests** for core logic and regressions

### Why it matters
This project demonstrates the engineering discipline required in **high-trust software**: clear control flow, testability, and extensibility without rewriting core logic.

### Tech
Python • OOP (inheritance/polymorphism) • State machine • PyTest • Validation & error handling

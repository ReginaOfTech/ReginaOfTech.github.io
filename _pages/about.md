I’m a software engineer with nearly a decade of experience across government and commercial environments, focused on building systems that are reliable, understandable, and built to last.

My work centers on **AI-enabled software**, but always with a production-first mindset. I care about correctness, validation, and clarity—not novelty for its own sake. The systems I build are designed to be testable, auditable, and usable by the people who depend on them.

I’ve led technical efforts as a **Test Lead** and currently guide internal knowledge-sharing as the lead of an **AI Roundtable**, where I help teams approach AI with discipline, realism, and good engineering judgment.

I tend to work best at the intersection of:
- applied AI and traditional software engineering  
- structured workflows and flexible system design  
- security-conscious development and practical delivery  

For professional inquiries, I can be found on LinkedIn.

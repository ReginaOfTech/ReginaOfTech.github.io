I’m a software engineer with nearly a decade of experience across government and commercial environments.

My focus is building AI-enabled systems that are reliable and practical—software that holds up under real constraints and earns trust through clarity, testing, and measurable outcomes.

I approach security as an engineering property—built through validation, auditability, and disciplined system design.

I also lead knowledge-sharing initiatives as the head of an internal AI Roundtable, helping teams approach AI with discipline and good judgment.

For professional inquiries, I can be found on LinkedIn.
